	<h2>Audiost@t</h2>
	Audiost@t is a web app designed for teachers. It allows them to assess and grade students' phonetical skills and pronunciation in French.

	It allows teachers to create new exercises (new texts to read). The students can record themselves reading the text and and the teacher can then tag all the pronunciation errors in the text using a correction code (with symbols, arrows, underlined letters, etc.)
