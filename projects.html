		Audiost@t was created for the University of Toronto and is used by several of their French language teachers.
		<p>Audiost@t is a web plateform designed for teachers that allows them to assess and grade students' phonetical skills and pronunciation in French.
		</p>
		<p>
		It allows teachers to create new exercises (new texts to read). The students can record themselves reading the text and the teacher can then tag all the pronunciation errors in the text using a correction code (with symbols, arrows, underlined letters, etc.)
		<p>
		There is an entire login system for students and teachers. Teachers can enroll students in their classes and grade them on their work and progress.
		</p>
		<p>
		This platform took several months to design and build, since I was the only designer and developper in the team. It uses an Apache server (on AWS) with PHP and a MySQL database. It was built entirely from scratch.
		</p>
		<p>
		One of the challenges of this app was to engineer a system to put the different color symbols over the text and have them change their shapes when the text is resized within a different container. It generates SVGs on the fly, depending on the position and length of the text selected.
		</p>
		<p>
		It uses the HTML5 Web Audio API to record and play sounds within the browser, and canvas to draw the waveform of the sounds recorded. There is also an MP3 encoder that takes the recorded data from the microphone and exports it into an MP3 file on the server.

		<p>
		A web app designed for students who are learning French and want to practice their pronunciation.
		</p>
		<p>
		Students need to perform an audio dubbing of a movie sequence in French.
		</p>
		<p>
		The back-end of this platform was built using an Apache server and PHP. It uses a MySQL database to store all the student information and JSON files to encode the different exercices.
		</p>
		<p>
		On the front-end side, it is built on JavaScript and uses the Web Audio API to record sounds within the browser. The text animations are made using CSS transitions. The app automatically calculates the speed of the scrolling text.
		</p>
		<p>
		There is a web interface to create new exercises and synchronize the text with the uploaded video.

		One of the games I designed and coded in C# (using the Unity Game Engine). The characters are inspired by colleagues from a previous job. One is a longtime softball player/fan, and the other is a guitar player.
